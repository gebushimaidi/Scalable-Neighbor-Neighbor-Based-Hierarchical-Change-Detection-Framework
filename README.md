# Scalable-Neighbor-Neighbor-Based-Hierarchical-Change-Detection-Framework

### A novel time series similarity based change detection framework for identifying inter-annual changes by exploiting phenological properties of growing crops from satellite time series imagery.



The algorithm implementation is written in c++ with CUDA to accelerate the computation.
